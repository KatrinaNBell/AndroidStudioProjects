Screen brightness/ Audio Implementation

Attribute: SCREEN_BRIGHTNESS
+encoder set screen brightness with appropriete value to encode the required information
+ decoder can read the value to get info

- any app can change the screen brightness from 0 - 2^8 when the SCREEN_BRIGHTNESS_MODE is at 0
- an encoder can convert an information of length 8 bits to an integer which can be set as a screen brightness value.

Stream volume settings:
STREAM ALARM, STREAM DTMF, STREAM MUSIC, STREAM NOTIFICATION, 
STREAM RING, STREAM SYSTEM, STREAM VOICE CALL

+ get integer value on each componant using setStreamVolume. 
+ range of integer values allowed for each component can be obtained using the getStreamMaxVolume method
A bit length is calculated as log2(#range), where #range is the number of discrete
values in the range. For example, there are 16 discrete values in the range for
component M. Therefore, its bit length is log2(16) = 4 i.e. 4 bits can be used
to encode any of the 16 discrete values.
